# Hi, i'm Alex ðŸ‘‹ ![]()
## I am learning python for backend development

### In **2021**, he studied as a Frontend developer.
### He mastered **HTML**, **CSS**, learned to work with **Sass** and **Less** preprocessors, as well as minimized the code and wrote very little in **JavaScript**. He wrote the code according to the BEM methodology and superficially touched **Gulp** and **Node.js** for himself to automate many tasks, such as minimifying the file when assembling the project, compressing the image without losing quality, as well as to create and launch a web server. [The portfolio on GitHub]((https://github.com/AlexandrKhorosh)) has repositories with my completed training projects. In the learning process, I realized that Backend is much more interesting for me and that I want to develop in this direction, especially in **Python** for its limitless capabilities. At the moment, I am actively studying Python and am ready to make every effort to reach great heights in this direction.
